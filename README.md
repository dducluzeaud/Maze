# Maze

The maze is a game made with pygame. You are McGyver in this game and you have to collect 3 items if you want to be able to put Murdoc (the worst ennemy of McGyver) to sleep and win the game.
In order to move McGyver use the arrow key. If you want to see how many items you have already collected press tab. Do the same, if you want to go back play.
When you have encountered McGyver, you will be able to play again by striking the key C or Q to quit.
